# RickAndMorty (Betterfly challenge 2021)
This was the challenge that I had to develop to demonstrate my skills and knowledge as an Android Developer.

## Challenge
Build an Android app that meets the following requirements:

- Have a screen with a list of items. The information for the list must be obtained from a cloud service (we suggest using the following example API: https://rickandmortyapi.com/. Please contact us immediately before starting the challenge if you prefer not to use this example as a guide (so you can explain why you don't want to use the R&M API and which one you'd like to use).
- Have a screen with item details. When an item is selected from the list, it should show the detailed screen.
- Optional: integrate Firebase with 1 or more of its tools (example: Authentication, Firestore, etc.).

The app should be uploaded to a repository so that Betterfly's developers can view the code (and compile it if they wish).
- The language must be native, meaning Java or -preferably- Kotlin, but there are no specific requirements for tools or libraries to be used.
- The developer can use whatever they prefer based on their comfort level.

## How I developed the app
- Architecture: MVVM
- Language: Kotlin
